# Todo

- re-figure out the authentication to google API shit
- write some basic authentication and token refreshing code
  - have the refresh token stored somewhere locally.
  - have a method that tries to authenticate using that refresh token first so that we don't have to go into authentication hell every time we want to do something.
- write at least the `show_stats` command
- write (maybe) the `set_temperature` command
